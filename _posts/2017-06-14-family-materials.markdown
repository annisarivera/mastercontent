### [Link to the code][familyMaterialsCode]

#### There are 6944 unique materials that families are using across our master content

### Families with high count of materials in library
"High count" refers to families that have more than 100 materials in their material library. This becomes a problem when loading these families into the project as these redundant materials will also be loaded into the project.

What can be seen from the image above is that there are families that have more than 1000 families? Upon closer inspection these are paint manufacturer families who have listed all their colours available from their company.

**For example: Dulux_ Colour Family_Blues_GEN**
