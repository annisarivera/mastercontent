### Number of families in each folder

The image below represents the number of families there are within each folder from the mastercontent library - This includes anything within subfolders.  

***NOTE: The x axis in the graph spits out the shorter version of the family path. For example:***

**\dc2-file001\Practice\InfoTech\BIM\Revit\RevitStandardsMasterBVN\02_BVN_Library\Master Content\Windows\Double Hung\Double Hung_3 Panel.rfa** 

is renamed as **\Windows\Double Hung**\

### Number of families in a Category (Highest Offenders)

The image below shows folders that only have less than 15 families in them. What can be seen is that a fair few of the subfolders only contain 1 family. Why? Should we merge folders together?
